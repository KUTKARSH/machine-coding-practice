# Low-Level Design Practice (Java)

This repository is dedicated to practicing **popular Low-Level Design (LLD) problems** commonly asked in software engineering interviews. Each module demonstrates a real-world system or component with an emphasis on:

- ‚úÖ Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- ‚úÖ SOLID Principles
- ‚úÖ Design Patterns (Strategy, Factory, State, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Encapsulation and Abstraction
- ‚úÖ Thread-safety and Concurrency (where applicable)

---

## Goals

- Practice designing modular, extensible, and testable systems
- Demonstrate clean, maintainable Java code
- Apply real-world software engineering principles
- Prepare for LLD/OOP interview rounds at top tech companies

---

## What's Included

Each module includes:

- Clear separation of models, services, and controllers
- Adherence to **Single Responsibility** and **Open/Closed** principles
- Extensible and reusable interfaces and abstractions
- Realistic use-cases to simulate system behavior
- Console-based simulation via `main()` methods

---

## Tools & Technologies

- üíª Language: Java 8+
- üß∞ Patterns: Strategy, Factory, State, Observer (as needed)
- üìê Principles: SOLID, DRY, KISS, YAGNI
- ‚öôÔ∏è Multithreading & synchronization (select scenarios)

---

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repo
2. Open in any Java IDE (IntelliJ, Eclipse, etc.)
3. Run the main class for each module to simulate functionality
